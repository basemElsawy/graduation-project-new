          workout and keep a healthy lifestyle and specially in some places in
          the middle-east bacame really expensive and that every single place
          will indirectly force you to pay for a personal coach and also they
          dont do their job not to mention the amount of money they take from
          each "client" here you wont be called client and you wont have to pay
          except a less than a half a dollar worth of membership here you become
          your own gym partner and you literaly become your own coach you can
          also make your own diet and be your own physiotherapist since i have
          gathered enough material for your journey also you can choose paths
          wether you want to start bodybuilding,powerlifting or weightlifting
          and sooner or later we'll be adding more sports to the game .

              Powerlifting is composed of three lifts: the squat, bench press,
              and deadlift. Anyone who has ever worked out at a gym has either
              done bench presses or at least seen someone do them. Benches are
              so popular as you can handle greater weights in the bench press
              than any other upper body exercise. And they are a great exercise
              for chest, shoulder, and triceps development. <br> But the other two
              lifts are not quite as popular, but they should be! Squats are the
              best exercise there is for developing leg and hip strength while
              deadlifts utilize just about every muscle in the body, so they
              develop total body strength.<br> In fact, performing just the three
              powerlifts is about all one needs for a sound training program,
              and no other exercises will provide the strength and muscular
              gains that the three powerlifts provide.<br> The page Proper
              Performance of the Powerlifts explains details in this regard, so
              it will not be repeated here. <br> But it will be said here, if you
              are not incorporating these three lifts in your training program
              then you are not making the strength and muscular size gains that
              you could be.<br> And of course, if you are thinking of competing in a
              powerlifting contest, you need to be performing the powerlifts in
              training.

              They say you can’t chase two rabbits. To that I say: shut up, I
              will do what I want! Power building is all about chasing two
              rabbit.<br />
              Essentially, power building is the process of building muscle size
              at the same time as building muscle strength and giving neither
              particular importance over the other.<br />
              As people become more and more interested in performance, the idea
              of getting stronger has become increasingly popular.
              <br />Meanwhile, simply building muscle size for the sake of
              appearances has started to fall out of favour. But here’s the
              problem: people still want to look strong! While you can pretend
              you don’t care what you look like at all, we all know you’re
              lying! This is a problem, seeing as generally the training methods
              involved in building strength are considered contrary to those
              used to build size. <br />Powerbuilding thus presents something of
              a challenge, in that your training has to be optimized for two
              separate (albeit related) goals. In this post, I’ll be looking at
              how powerbuilding works and at what the best way to train size and
              strength at the same time might be. At the same time, I’ll also be
              looking at some of the shortcomings of traditional methods and
              suggesting a few new ones of my own.

              Calisthenics, also called Street Workout, gained worldwide
              reputation after 2008 video of Hannibal for King went viral on
              YouTube. Since then, increasingly more people have trained it as
              well as national and international competitions have emerged. It
              derives its name from two Greek words kálos which means beauty and
              sthénos which means strength. Calisthenics is a discipline in which
              you train your whole body using only bodyweight exercises. You have
              probably seen people doing gravity-defying gymnastic figures such as
              Front Lever and Planche or dynamic acrobatic skills on the bars such
              as Muscle Up. This is the sole idea of Calisthenics – to perform
              workouts with nothing else but your own body.

              If you’re trying to develop an aesthetic body, a great first step is
              to get a visual image of how you want to look. A good idea is to
              find bodybuilders or athletes that are similar in height to you.
              They should have a physique like the one you want to develop. Do you
              want an aesthetic bodybuilding physique? You might want an aesthetic
              physique with a little less muscle. Regardless, you will need to
              work on your proportions, symmetry, balance, and conditioning. This
              means a small waist, a good V-taper, and quads big enough to make
              the knees look small. Also, the quads should have a good outer
              sweep. And, don’t forget the calves! For example, Samir Bannout was
              well-known for his aesthetics and proportions. Finding examples of an aesthetic body
              that is inspiring to you is a powerful motivator to help you create
              your own aesthetic physique? Study the physique so you can create a
              clear mental image and train accordingly to bring to life what you
              see in your mind.

       <div class="article-lifting">Weightlifting is an olympic sport, and has been contested in every Summer Olympic Games since 1920. Whilst the sport is officially named "weightlifting", the terms "olympic weightlifting" and "olympic-style weightlifting" are often used to distinguish it from the other sports and events that involve the lifting of weights, such as powerlifting, weight training, and strongman events. Similarly, the snatch and clean-and-jerk are known as the "olympic lifts".
      <br>
        While other strength sports test limit strength, olympic-style weightlifting also tests aspects of human ballistic limits (explosive strength): the olympic lifts are executed faster, and with more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution, than other barbell lifts. The olympic lifts, and their component lifts (e.g., cleans, squats) and their variations (e.g., power snatch, power clean) are used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength.
